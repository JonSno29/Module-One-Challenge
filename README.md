 # MODULE-ONE-CHALLENGE


## OVERVIEW:
Over the course of a few days, my focus was to add semantic elements to the Index.HTML. The elements helped me build this project to test out my skills as a new Developer, Learning this helped me become more efficient as a Web Developer. As of now, my project probably will not stand out, i'm new to Coding and new to computers.
